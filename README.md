# Sample Assignment

This is a simple C++ assignment for practice using Github Classroom and
Codespaces.

Write a C++ program that prompts for and inputs two integers, then calculates
and outputs the sum of those two integers.

Here is a sample run of the program:

```
Enter first integer: 15
Enter second integer: 22

The sum is 37.
```

A source code file named *sample.cpp* is included in this project for you
to add your code. When you are ready to test your code, use the "Run and Debug" 
button on the left side panel (your editor must be open to the file you wish
to compile and run, i.e. *sample.cpp*). The program output will appear in the 
lower panel. Note that the lower panel contains tabs for "Debug Console" and 
"Terminal". Your program runs in the "Terminal" tab (you may have to switch to
it manually).

When your program is finished and you are ready to submit the assignment, you
must "push" your changes to the Github repository. Do this using the "Source Control"
button in the left panel. First, you need to commit your changes to the project.
This saves your project changes to the local repository, but does not submit to
your Github repository (you instructor will only see your Github repository).

When you commit changes to your project, an editor will open for you to enter a 
comment that briefly describes the changes you made. Enter the comment on the first
line and close the editor to complete the commit.

Once you are ready to submit the project to your instructor, you must push your
local reposity to the Github repository. Again, use the "Source Control" button
and "push" (or "sync") your local repository to the Github repository. You can
push changes up to the due date for the assignment. Once it is pushed, the
reposity is available to your instructor for grading. Note that pushes after the
due date are permitted, however you instructor only receives the latest push that
was done prior to the due date and time.
